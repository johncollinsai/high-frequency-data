    "***In this post I discuss the preparation of high frequency datasets for Apple (Apple Inc., NASDAQ, ticker: AAPL), JPM (JPMorgan Chase & Co., NYSE, ticker: JPM), and the EURUSD currency pair. I use volatility prediction as my problem setting because the second moment dominates. Careful data cleaning is one of the most important aspects of working with high frequency data and it is not always straightforward to construct a time series of interest from raw tick data. The methods I employ to prepare my data and compute a returns series are therefore are not trivial. I shall use these datasets in several of my subsequent posts, so a thorough exposition of the steps I have taken along with description of the resultant datasets is important. I consider the data from the perspective of the financial econometrician; subsequently I shall contront the data with a variety of deep learning and reinforcement learning methods and a solid understanding of the data will help the interpretation of results. This is a lengthy and detailed post, with many references to supporting research. I hope to show, amongst other things, that simply fitting a time series of asset prices to a deep learning neural network, without proper consideration of the data itself and what it means, is a necessary but not sufficient condition for robust results. Put another way, when we obtain a prediction from our model, how certain can we be that what we observe is signal and not noise.***"

    "In classic models of asset pricing $X$, the log of an asset price, is assumed to follow an Ito semimartingale. This model originates with Bachelier (1900), Osborne (1959), Cootner (1964), Samuelson (1965), and Mandelbrot (1966); the current paradigm was introduced and formalized using stochastic analysis by Merton in a series of seminal contributions (collectively, see Merton (1992). For an asset pricing model to avoid arbitrage opportunities, asset prices must follow semimartingales (see, for example, Ait-Sahalia & Jacod (2014), Robert & Rosenbaum (2012), Delbaen & Schachermayer (1994), and Harrison & Pliska (1981)). A semimartingale can be decomposed into the sum of a drift, a continuous local martingale, and a discontinuous part. The continuous component can be scaled by a stochastic volatility process, which may be correlated with the asset price, and may itself be a semimartingale. From a continuous-time financial econometrics perspective, methods were initially developed to estimate models using low frequency data only (again see Ait-Sahalia & Jacod (2014); also  Ait-Sahalia (1996) and Hansen & Scheinkman (1995)). Subsequent availability of high frequency data then enabled the development of methods with the objective of estimating the volatility component using estimators such as realized volatility (RV) (Liu, Patton & Sheppard (2015) and Andersen, Bollerslev & Diebold (2010) provide detailed reviews). \n",

    "However, at high frequency (HF), the properties of volatility estimators may be radically altered by the presence of \"microstructure noise\". This insight stemmed from the development of methods to make high frequency volatility estimators more robust. Initially these methods focused exclusively on models with continuous sample paths. They include, in chronological order, the two scales realized volatility (TSRV) estimator of Zhang, Mykland & Ait-Sahalia (2005), the maximum likelihood approach of Ait-Sahalia, Mykland & Zhang (2005), the multi-scaled realized volatility (MSRV) of Zhang (2006), the realized kernels of Barndorff-Nielsen, Hansen, Lunde & Shephard (2009, 2008, 2007), the preaveraging approach of Jacod, Li, Mykland, Podolski & Vetterd (2009), and the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator of Xiu (2010). This work is augmented by more recent work from Figueroa & Wu (2020), Andersen, Thyrsgaard, & Todorov (2018), Bollerslev, Li, & Xue (2018), Bollerslev, Hood, Huss & Pedersen (2017), along with earlier work by Ait-Sahalia, Mykland & Zhang (2012, 2011), Gatheral & Oomen (2010), Li, Mykland, Renault, Zhang, & Zheng, (2010), Kalnina & Linton (2008), Cheng & Sen (2008), Li & Mykland (2007), Fan & Wang (2007), Hansen & Lunde (2006), Bandi & Russel (2006), and Delattre & Jacod (1997).\n",

    "RV provides a consistent estimate of the quadratic variation of asset prices when prices follow a continuous stochastic model and are directly observed (see, for example, the pioneering papers of Barndorff-Nielsen & Shephard (2002) and Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold & Labys (2003)). This is compelling and it makes RV a very simple and natural volatility estimator. RV is also, as noted by Ait-Sahalia & Yu (2009), possessed of the most desirable properties. For instance, in the context of parametric volatility models, RV is not only the least squares estimator or the method of moments estimator with the sample variance as the moment function, but also the maximum likelihood estimator. The asymptotic properties of RV are striking when sampling occurs at an increasing frequency that is a realistic approximation to what is observed with, for example, the nano-second NYSE Trades and Quotes and HF FX data that are my data here. In particular, fully observing the sample path of an asset can be shown, in the limit, to perfectly reveal the volatility of that path. This result is nonparametric in nature, in that the estimator will converge to the quadratic variation of the process, and holds in great generality for semimartingales. However, in an HF empirical setting, things are not necessarily as simple as these asymptotic results suggest. Controlling for microstructure noise that is prevalent at high frequencies is a key issue.\n",

    "Microstructure noise captures a wide range of frictions inherent in the information flows associated with the trading process; an insight that goes back to Roll (1984) and Hasbrouck (1993). Ait-Sahalia & Jacod (2014) and Menkveld (2016), for example, describe the frictions as bid-ask bounce, discreteness of price changes, differences in trade sizes or informational content of price changes, gradual response of prices to a block trade, strategic component of the order flow, and inventory control effects. Bacry, Delattre, Hoffmann & Muzy (2013) describe microstructure noise as strong mean reversion effects at small scales. Theoretically, since at least Merton (1980), it is known that spot volatility may be inferred perfectly if the asset price follows a diffusion process and a continuous record of prices is available. But, as shown consistently in academic research, by practitioners, and indeed in my posts on this site, practical implementation presents significant challenges. \n",

    "Firstly, even within the nano-second time-frames of current market infrastructures and operations, prices are yet only observed at intermittent and discrete points in time. This induces discretization errors. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, recorded quotes and prices do not reflect direct observations of a frictionless diffusive process. The order book is the dominant system now in financial markets. It matches orders on a price-time priority and keeps track of all previously submitted buy and sell limit orders on a discrete grid of prices. Prices therefore are quoted on this discrete price grid with a Bid-Ask spread, so that markedly different prices may be quoted simultaneously by competing market makers due to a broad range of factors (an expanding body of work has addressed this observation: see for example Stoikov (2020), Dacorogna (2018), Bollerslev, Li & Xue (2018), Lehalle & Mounjid (2018), Lehalle & Laruelle (2014), Robert & Rosenbaum (2012), Andersen, Bollerslev & Meddahi (2011), and  Gatheral & Oomen (2010)). Complications include heterogeneous beliefs (see for example, Rousseau, Boco & Germain (2016) and Diebold & Strasser (2013)), information (Andersen, Bollerslev & Meddahi (2011)), transactions costs (Amihud, Mendelson & Pedersen (2005)), inventory positions (Andersen, Bollerslev & Meddahi (2011)), inter-trade duration (Zikes, Barunik & Shenai (2018), Aldrich, Heckenbach & Laughlin (2014), Chen, Diebold & Schorfheide (2013), Robert & Rosenbaum (2012), Sun & Engle (2007), and Engle (2000)),  volume (Bollerslev, Li & Xue (2018), Ait-Sahalia, Mykland & Zhang (2011), Griffin & Oomen (2011)), and liquidity (Ait-Sahalia & Yu (2009), Ait-Sahalia & Mykland (2009)). Variously at times, often collectively, these complications are labeled microstructure noise. Consequently, any observed price may be regarded to not represent a unique market price but instead an underlying ideal price that is confounded by an error term reflecting the impact of this 'noise'. The biggest contributory factor to microstructure noise has been consistently shown to be Bid-Ask bounce (Lehalle & Laruelle (2014), Ait-Sahalia, Mykland & Zhang (2010), Almgren (2009), Barndorff-Nielsen, Hansen, Lunde & Shephard (2009), Dacorogna, Gencay, Muller, Olsen, & Pictet (2001)). \n",

    "The importance attributed to Bid-Ask bounce with regard to microstructure noise may be explained as follows. At very high frequencies (i.e. tick data) underlying volatility may be zero. But, buyers and sellers are still present and consequently prices are observed at Bid or Ask, rather than at mid-price. Because of that, if I choose a classical quadratic variation estimate for squared volatility, even with an underlying volatility of zero, I will measure a lot of time ${\\left(P_{Ask} - P_{Bid} \\right)}^2$.  I may model this with additive noise, $\\epsilon_t$, so that, when the mid-price between $0$ and $T$ follows a discretized arithmetic Brownian motion, $P_{\\left(k+1 \\right)\\delta} = P_{k\\delta} + \\sigma \\sqrt{\\delta} \\xi_{k+1}$, the price I observe at $k\\delta$ is $P_{k\\delta} + \\epsilon_k$.

    "Early approaches to the problem of microstructure noise consisted of discarding the data sampled at the highest frequencies, as the 'noisiest', in order to sample instead at 15 minute, 30 minute, or even longer intervals (see Andersen, Bollerslev, Christoffersen & Diebold (2006), Barndorff-Nielsen & Shephard (2007), Meddahi, Mykland & Shephard (2011) for comprehensive reviews of these early approaches). To quote Zhang, Mykland, & Ait-Sahalia (2005), “it is difficult to accept that throwing away data, especially in such quantities, can be an optimal solution”. I may now explicitly incorporate microstructure noise into the analysis, so that estimators make use of all the data, or as much data as I may choose to use. These methods make it possible to decompose the total observed variance into a component attributable to the fundamental price signal and one attributable to the microstructure noise. These estimators may also, in some settings, produce consistent estimates of the magnitude of the market microstructure noise at high frequencies, thereby producing a decomposition of total asset return volatility into fundamental and noise components. At least two distinct approaches to modeling this noise component may be encountered. \n",

    "Firstly, and most common, is the use of an additive noise that is independent of the efficient price (studies following this approach include  Ait-Sahalia, Mykland & Zhang (2010), Zhang (2006), Ait-Sahalia, Mykland & Zhang (2005), Bandi & Russel (2005), and Zhang, Mykland & Ait-Sahalia (2005)).

A potential limitation of these approaches is that they do not allow for prices discreteness. A second, alternative approach is where microstructure noise is proposed as cases of a contamination of the efficient price through a Markov kernel (this approach is followed in studies by Jacod, Li, Mykland, Podolski, & Vetterd (2009), and Li & Mykland (2007)), and as a rounding error (Delattre & Jacod (1997) and Li & Mykland (2008)).

    "The consequences of data handling procedures upon subsequent statistical analysis may be significant (Brownlees & Gallo (2006)). For example, Hansen & Lunde (2006) show that removing large numbers of observations can improve volatility estimation. This result may appear counterintuitive, but the reasoning is quite straightforward: An estimator that makes optimal use of all data will typically put high weight on accurate data and be less influenced by the least accurate observations. Barndorff-Nielsen, Hansen, Lunde & Shephard (2009) develop a good analogy for this using the generalized least squares estimator in the classical regression model. Conversely, the precision of the standard least squares estimator can deteriorate when relatively noisy observations are included in the estimation. Thus the inclusion of poor quality observations can cause more harm than good to the least squares estimator. Realized volatility kernels and related estimators \"treat all observations equally\" (Barndorff-Nielsen, Hansen, Lunde & Shephard (2008)) so that a few outliers can severely influence these estimators. By contrast, I am concerned with the extent to which deep learning and reinforcement learning are able to treat observations differently and perform better as a result.  There is therefore an important balance to be struck in the process of data preparation between too little data cleansing and too much. As a result, a great deal of raw data analysis and trial-and-error experimentation has accompanied the data preparation process described subsequently in this post.\n",

The selection of these two particular stocks is ultimately an arbitrary model setting choice. However, Ait-Sahalia & Jacod (2012) show that market microstructure noise is greater in NASDAQ-listed stocks than Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stocks listed on NYSE. A cursory look at the performance of the stocks over the period of analysis (see Fig 3 for example) suggests prima facie that the behaviour of these two stocks might differ somewhat in ways that are interesting. The data is obtained from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Trade and Quote (TAQ) database. TAQ is an historical archive of daily files containing all trades and quotes for all issues listed and traded on US regulated exchanges for each single trading day. Daily TAQ files thus comprise the entire history of intra-day transactions data for all securities traded on NYSE, Nasdaq and US regional Exchanges (collectively henceforth the Exchange or Exchanges). TAQ consolidates the National Best Bid Offer (NBBO) with quote, trade and other messages from the Exchanges. The NBBO is calculated and disseminated by Security Information Processors (the SIP) as part of the National Market System Plan (NMSP), which is used to process security prices. There are two SIPs responsible for this task: the Consolidated Quotation System gives the NBBO for securities listed on NYSE; and the Unlisted Trading Privileges Quote Data Feed gives the NBBO for securities listed on NASDAQ. The NBBO updates throughout the day with the highest and lowest offers for a security among the Exchanges and market makers. The lowest Ask price and the highest Bid price are displayed in the NBBO and are not required to come from the same Exchange. I obtained TAQ data in the form of compressed historical daily files and extracted it using Python. I used Python to select JPM and AAPL tickers, process the data, analyze, cleanse, consolidate, and prepare it for the computation of WeightedMidPrice log returns. I ultimately consolidate the data into a single time-series. The starting point for data preparation is thus 565 daily files, each comprising several gigabytes of data, or millions of underlying transaction (price-quote) records.  \n",

The choice of 100 observations is ad hoc (Barndorff-Nielsen, Hansen, Lunde & Shephard (2009), for example, use 50), but based upon a considerable amount of experimentation with different settings.\n",

    "I filter out Bids and Asks that are not originating from a public Exchange. Non-public trading, for example trades done internally by broker dealers (i.e. when a broker dealer crosses two orders internally to create a trade, block trades, and/or when two institutional orders are crossed to create a trade), dark pools (i.e. private Exchanges deemed \"dark\" because the orders cannot be seen), and Over The Counter (OTC) trades, are included in the TAQ daily files along with associated quote activity. Regulation National Market System (Reg NMS), a set of rules passed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2005, requires all trades to be reported; thus private trading, trades executed outside of public Exchanges, along with associated quote activity are reported to a Trade Reporting Facility (TRF). TRFs are provided by the Exchanges, which then publish to the SIP. Reg NMS allows up to 10 seconds after execution for a report to be sent to a TRF. This can result in the inclusion on the TAQ at a given instance in time of TRF information that is not within the current NBBO and, as a result, prices and sizes may be unrealistic in proximity to TRF information.\n",

    "Evidence is mixed regarding the impact of private trading. O’Hara & Ye (2011) examine effective spreads, realized spreads, execution speed, short-term volatility, and variance ratios and show that fragmentation arising from Reg NMS is associated with lower spreads, faster execution, and prices that are closer to a random walk; however they also find evidence of increased short-term volatility. Conversely, Chung and Chuwonganant (2012) report that Reg NMS has led to increases in quoted and effective spreads, slower execution, and reduced depth, concluding that fragmentation arising from Reg NMS hurts market quality. Foley & Reynolds (2018) and Haslag & Ringgenberg (2016) report similar findings with regard to negative impacts of Reg NMS. Barndorff-Nielsen, Hansen, Lunde & Shephard (2009) report that it is better to analyze Exchanges separately than treat all data as if it was from a single source, and filter TAQ to NYSE entries only in their work.  Hansen & Lunde (2006) also showed that pooling mid-quotes from multiple exchanges can induce additional noise that overshadows the endogenous noise found in single exchange mid-quotes. However, almost a decade later, Bartlett & McCrary (2019), report that delay in information flows onto the SIP from the different Exchanges \"is miniscule and becomes smaller every year\". These authors show, for example, that SIP-reported NBBO matches a calculated NBBO  without reporting latencies for 97% of observed data. Moreover, they report that this result was generally persistent across the Exchanges.\n",

    "Table 5 reports some features of the datasets; they further illustrate the sylized facts described above: almost unpredictable returns, fat tails, and volatility clustering. The mean is close to zero relative to the standard deviations for all datasets. The standard deviations are naturally observed to be much higher for equities than for FX over the 27 months of observation. The kurtosis of HF datasets is interesting. This of course measures the magnitude of the extremes. If the HF returns are normally distributed, then the kurtosis should be 3. The kurtosis for the equities is very high, approximately 63 for AAPL and even higher, approximately 90, for JPM. It is also very high, approximately 46, for EURUSD. This indicates that the extremes observed in some of the above charts (for example, recall figures 4 and 5) are substantial.\n",

    "I now show within my AAPL, JPM, and EURUSD 1-minute returns data some of the key features of observed HF returns distributions and discuss them. For example, how persistent is volatility? And how quickly do financial markets forget large volatility shocks? Figures 7 and 8 show 1-minute WMP returns for AAPL, JPM, and EURUSD exhibit significant autocorrelations over many lags. Initially, volatility models did a relatively poor job of capturing this phenomena. In any stationary ARCH or GARCH model, memory decays exponentially fast. For example, if $\\{ \\epsilon_t \\}$ are ARCH($1$), the $\\{ \\epsilon_t^2 \\}$ have autocorrelations $\\rho_k = \\alpha^k$. Specifically, if $\\alpha = 0.8$ and $k = 20$, then $\\rho_{20} = 0.012$. This is likely to be an unrealistically fast decay. Conversely however, for any integrated ARCH or GARCH, $\\rho_k = 1$ for all $k$, so there is no decay at all. This of course is unrealistically slow. Neither reflects what my data shows. At one level of abstraction, the progression from ARCH(1) to ARCH($q$) to GARCH represented an attempt to allow for the strong volatility persistence observed in actual data. Typically the exponential decay inherent in any stationary ARCH or GARCH model is too rapid to adequately describe the data, especially HF data, forcing the estimated models to be integrated. In reality, however, volatility may not be integrated, and the behavior of the estimated ARCH and GARCH models may simply be a signal that the memory is decaying relatively slowly compared to the exponential rate, or at several different rates.\n",

    "Figure 6 shows quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots of  AAPL, JPM, and EURUSD 1-minute, plus DEXJPUS daily returns distributions. Q-Q plots compare the quantiles of two distributions and are a powerful way to visualize points of departure between them. Thus figure 6 plots the empirical quantiles of each dataset against the theoretical quantiles of the Gaussian distribution obtained via maximum likelihood (although the quantiles on the x-axis have been standardized). If the theoretical and empirical densities coincide, their quantiles will exhibit a linear relationship. Departures are highlighted via nonlinearities in the Q-Q plot. I observe that AAPL, JPM and EURUSD 1-minute returns have heavy tails, which indicates that the probability distribution generating the data has higher probabilities of extreme events than a Gaussian distribution. The same is true, but to a lesser extent, for the DEXJPUS daily returns. The characteristic heavy tails of the empirical distributions are visible in the Q-Q plots as a convex-concave departure from linearity. The red line of best fit provides emphasis. The plots are consistent with other published results; for example, Dacorogna (2018) shows 10-minute, 1-day, and 1-week Q-Q plots for USDJPY on a normalized scale to illustrate the extent to which the distribution of 10-minute returns has a distinctly more S-shaped form than 1-day and 1-week returns. I note that my HF data covers the high volatility regime in Q1-2020 (recall the FRED DEXJPUS data covers the period June 1973 to June 2002, following Calvet & Fisher (2004)); the different sampling periods may also therefore be a factor. \n",

    "WMP is widely used in practice (see for example Stoikov (2020), Dacorogna (2018), Lehalle & Mounjid (2018), and Gatheral & Oomen (2010)), and has also been used by researchers (Ait-Sahalia, Mykland & Zhang (2010), for example, compute log-returns from quotes using a bid-ask midpoint, weighted by the respective depth of the two sides). The typical explanation (from a practitioner) for use of WMP is that, the larger quantity of shares on the Bid than on the Ask typically observed, indicates greater buying pressure, and therefore the \"true\" price is closer to the Ask than to the Bid. Thus, it follows, and is a reasonable assumption, that market buy/sell orders arriving are likely to be roughly matched and thus use the quantities at the Bid and Ask to adjust for the concomitant movement in the price. It is this mechanism that negates or reduces Bid-Ask bounce.\n",
